						INTRODUCTION
						<ol>
							<li>
								<b>PURPOSE OF POLICY.</b> Star Van Lines (“us”, “we,” “Company”)
								is committed to respecting the privacy rights of visitors and
								other users of https://starvanlinesmovers.com/ (the “Site”). We
								created this Privacy Policy (this “Policy”) to give you
								confidence as you visit and use the Site, and to demonstrate our
								commitment to fair information practices. This Policy is only
								applicable to the Site, and not to any other websites that you
								may be able to access from the Site, each of which may have data
								collection and use practices and policies that differ materially
								from this Policy.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b> NOTICE CONCERNING CHILDREN</b>
								<br />
								PLEASE NOTE: We are a general audience site, and do not direct
								any of our content specifically at children under 13 years of
								age pursuant to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of
								1998.

						INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES
						<ol>
							<li>
								<b>WHAT BASIC INFORMATION DOES THE COMPANY COLLECT?</b>
								<br />
								In operating the Site, we collect personal information from you
								in a couple different situations. The first is if you should
								contact us via the “contact” page or fill out any of the various
								“moving quote” forms. You are not required to provide your
								personally identifiable information when you visit the Site.
								However, in order to obtain information, including quotes from
								Service providers (“Vendors”), you must fill out and submit a
								quote request form containing personally identifiable
								information including without limitation your name, email
								address, addresses, phone number, home types, automobile
								information, move dates, and information pertaining to your
								service needs (a “Quote Request). The second is if you leave a
								comment to a blog post during which you may be asked for a name
								and other information. You are not required to provide us with
								information via these two methods to use and enjoy the Site.
							</li>
							<li>
								<b>WHAT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DOES COMPANY COLLECT?</b>
								<br />
								(a) AUTOMATIC COLLECTION. Our servers automatically recognize
								visitors’ domain names and IP addresses (the number assigned to
								computers on the Internet). No personal information about you is
								revealed in this process. The Site may also gather anonymous
								“traffic data” that does not personally identify you, but that
								may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the
								services we offer.
								<br /> <br />
								(b) COOKIES. We use the standard “cookies” feature of major
								browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of
								data on your computer about your visit to our Site. Cookies help
								us learn which areas of our Site are useful and which areas need
								improvement through programs including, but not limited to,
								Google Analytics. We may also use cookies from third party
								social sites and programs including, but not limited to,
								Facebook, Google Plus and Twitter. You can choose to disable
								cookies through your browser or independent programs available
								online. However, if you choose to disable this function, your
								experience at our Site may be diminished as some features may
								not work as they were intended.
								<br /> <br />
								(c) SPONSORS AND ADVERTISERS. We may decide to accept
								sponsorship and advertisements on the Site. Should this occur,
								you should assume said sponsors and advertisers will be given
								access to the impressions and click data on their marketing
								pieces.

					<li>
						USE AND SHARING OF INFORMATION
						<ol>
							<li>
								<b>WHAT DOES COMPANY DO WITH COLLECTED INFORMATION?</b>
								<br />
								(a) PERSONAL INFORMATION.
								<br />
								<p>
									1. If you submit a Quote Request, we will share the
									information you have provided with Vendors who may be able to
									provide Services to you. Although Vendors have agreed to
									protect your personally identifiable information pursuant to
									privacy standards which are at least as restrictive as the
									terms of this Privacy Policy, we do not and cannot control the
									use of your information after it is transmitted to the Vendor
									and cannot guarantee that the Vendor will not disclose, sell
									or use your information in a manner that you do not
									anticipate. You therefore must contact the Vendor if you have
									any questions or concerns regarding their use of your
									information.
								</p>
								<p>
									2. Your Quote Request may include an opportunity to
									participate in our direct marketing program or additional
									offers available in the Quote Request. If you opt-in to our
									direct marketing program or additional offers, we will share
									your information with third-party marketers and service
									providers for the purposes of marketing and advertising their
									products and services to you. After we share your information
									with such third-party marketers, we do not and cannot control
									the third-party marketers’ subsequent use or disclosure of
									your information and cannot guarantee that they will not
									disclose, sell or use your information in a manner that you do
									not anticipate. You therefore must contact the third-party
									marketers if you have any questions or concerns regarding
									their use of your information.
								</p>
								<p>
									3. We may also use the information you provide in your Quote
									Request to (i) contact you about your satisfaction with the
									Site, whether you obtained Services from any Vendor through
									the Site, the identity of any such Vendor, and your
									satisfaction with the Services provided by such Vendor, and
									(ii) to send you information and promotional messages about
									our associated products and services, or the products or
									services that we offer on this Site or on our other websites
								</p>
								<p>
									4. When you provide personal contact information in
									association with a Quote Request, you may be contacted by text
									message, email, or phone (possibly with auto-dialing or
									recorded messages) to get in touch to provide a quote. By
									submitting a Quote Request, you agree to be contacted using
									any of these methods and your consent is not a condition of
									purchase.
								</p>
								<br />
								(b) ANONYMOUS INFORMATION. We use anonymous information to
								analyze our Site traffic. In addition, we may use anonymous IP
								addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to
								administer our site, or to display the content according to your
								preferences. Traffic and transaction information may also be
								shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate
								and anonymous basis.
								<br /> <br />
								(c) USE OF COOKIES. Promotions or advertisements displayed on
								our site may contain cookies. We do not have access to or
								control over information collected by outside advertisers on our
								site.
								<br /> <br />
								(d) DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. We may disclose any
								information we have for you if required to do so by law or in
								the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (1)
								conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process
								served on us, (2) protect and defend our rights or property or
								the users of the Site, or (3) act under exigent circumstances to
								protect the safety of the public or users of the Site.
								<br /> <br />
								(e) SALE OF INFORMATION. In order to accommodate changes in our
								business, we may sell or buy portions of the Site or our
								company, including the information collected through this Site.
								If Company or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a
								third party, user information will be one of the assets
								transferred to the acquirer.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>
						SECURITY
						<p>
							The Site has security measures in place to prevent the loss,
							misuse, and alteration of the information that we obtain from you,
							but we make no assurances about our ability to prevent any such
							loss to you or to any third party arising out of any such loss,
							misuse, or alteration.
