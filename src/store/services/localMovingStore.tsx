			"When tipping long distance movers, it's important to consider a few factors. While tipping is not mandatory, it is a common practice to show appreciation for their hard work and professionalism. The number of moving tips can change based on service quality, move complexity, and your satisfaction. A general guideline is to tip around 5-10% of the total moving cost. If your move is difficult with heavy furniture, many stairs, or other challenges, you might want to tip more. If the moving services were not efficient or had issues, you can adjust the tip accordingly.",

		title:
			"How long does it take to move my household goods across United States?",
		content:
			"One of the main factors is the distance between your current location and your new destination. If you are moving from coast to coast, it generally takes longer compared to a shorter distance move within the same state. Another factor that affects the duration is the mode of transportation you choose. If you hire a professional moving company, they will provide you with an estimated time. We will estimate the time based on two factors: how far you are moving and the type of service you choose. Expedited delivery, the exact day delivery, fast shipping may increase the price of shipping cost.",
