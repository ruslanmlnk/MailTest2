		content:
			"When tipping long distance movers, it's important to consider a few factors. While tipping is not mandatory, it is a common practice to show appreciation for their hard work and professionalism. The number of moving tips can change based on service quality, move complexity, and your satisfaction. A general guideline is to tip around 5-10% of the total moving cost. If your move is difficult with heavy furniture, many stairs, or other challenges, you might want to tip more. If the moving services were not efficient or had issues, you can adjust the tip accordingly.",

	{
		title:
			"How long does it take to move my household goods across United States?",
		content:
			"One of the main factors is the distance between your current location and your new destination. If you are moving from coast to coast, it generally takes longer compared to a shorter distance move within the same state. Another factor that affects the duration is the mode of transportation you choose. If you hire a professional moving company, they will provide you with an estimated time. We will estimate the time based on two factors: how far you are moving and the type of service you choose. Expedited delivery, the exact day delivery, fast shipping may increase the price of shipping cost.",

			"Is it better to hire movers near me or big interstate company for long distance move? ",

			"Hiring local movers near you can offer several benefits. They know the area well, which helps with driving and finding the best routes. Local movers offer better customer service and pay more attention to detail compared to others. They may also be more flexible with scheduling, accommodating any last-minute changes or specific requirements you may have. On the other hand, interstate moving companies of considerable size have their own advantages as well. One of the key benefits is their extensive experience in handling long distance moves. They have the necessary resources, equipment, and expertise to efficiently transport your belongings across state lines.",
